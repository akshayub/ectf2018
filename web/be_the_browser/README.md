**Points** - 200

**Description** - For a change, this server won't accept requests made through a browser. Looks like we need to make HTTP requests by hand. The server is sitting behind the a proxy `ectf.proxy` and that is giving out the flag. Someone carelessly left their credentials for us. 

Username : `realuser` <br>
Password : `onehellofapassword`

**Hints** - Make sure you are setting the proper headers while constructing your HTTP requests
