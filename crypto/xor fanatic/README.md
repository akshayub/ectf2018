### Description

Mr. XORxes used his favorite operation to encipher a string. The enciphered string is in ciphertext.txt. To make sure he
hides his super secure secret using multiple levels of encryption, he encrypted it using encrypted.py. Prove to Mr. XORxes
that he definitely needs a better scheme to encrypt his secret!

### Hint

##### To be given only if no solves:
- Use the key obtained from the first level of encryption to open the locked file
- Mr. XORxes secret starts with ECTF{
