## Points

## Description
Encryption algorithms in cryptography deal only with numbers.
Hence, strings have to be first encoded into numeric digits before being encrypted.
Someone seemed to have encoded a flag and forgot about it:
31328546952449447678626887394444747858060314493686035155600478060530960852861

Can you decode it to get the flag?
