# Challenge: comment

# Points: 20

# Description: 

Do you know of any "comment" in an executable?

[This](./comment) is the file. 

# Hint: 

Use **readelf** / **objdump** . 

NOTE FOR US: This can be solved using strings also. .comment is just a string in an executable. If they solve the chal properly, then they would have learnt a bit about ELF!
